# WordNet 3.0 for Microsoft SQL Server, with views, functions, and stored procedures

This is an MS-SQL database containing WordNet 3.0, supporting [this WordNet GUI editor](https://github.com/GregWickham/WordNet_Editor_WPF) written for WPF.  It's derived from [the MS-SQL database created by Michal MÄ›chura.](https://github.com/michmech/wordnet-mssql)

The .zip file contains an MDF file that you can attach in SQL Server.  

The database schema has been extensively reworked, some table rows have been removed (but the original data is all there), and I've added a number of views, stored procedures, and functions.

The views make it easier to explore the contents of WordNet using SQL Server Management Studio.

The functions and stored procedures support [the WordNet editor.](https://github.com/GregWickham/WordNet_Editor_WPF)

The database defines a user named WordNetEditor, which has read / write / execute privileges on all the database objects needed by the WPF editor.  The simplest way to get the editor running is probably to create a login on your SQL Server instance that corresponds to this user.
